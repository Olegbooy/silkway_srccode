								Silkway Petrole strives to be a safety leader. We are committed to establishing and maintaining a safe and healthy workplace and an environment in which people demonstrate a strong commitment to the safety, health and well-being of themselves and those around them.
							</p>
							<p>
								To achieve this, we work in close partnership with our workforce to enhance the culture of safety in our workplace, and with our peers in the waterfront sector to share best practices and continuously improve our safety standards. A Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee, made up of ILWU employees and Silkway Petrole management, meets regularly to review safety matters and make recommendations for continuously improving our safety management systems.
