# Getting Started with Create React App

To install dependencies use cmd or terminal and type: "npm i" or "yarn"

This project was developed by me.

The company is engaged in the transportation of containers by tankers

The main features that the customer liked are the transition between pages without reloading the browser(react-router-dom) and animations(aos.js)

The email form was written by using react-hook-form
